  WeldAndArrow.Meta.AssumptionLedger
  Canonical assumption prose, checked anchors, and structural checks
================================================================================

The axiom-audit ledger keeps the compile-time tripwire for input-side
declarations. This ledger is the canonical source for the reader-facing
assumption prose and for the checked anchor metadata rendered to
`Exposition/Assumptions.md`.

Lean here buys internal consistency and derivability, not exclusivity or truth:
given the primitives the consequences follow without contradiction; it is not
shown that no other reconstruction would. The ledger and its axiom audit make
the “no added axioms” part concrete through `assumptionAxiomAudit` and
`#verify_axiom_audit`. Its declined entries — no `PreorderTop`, no privileged
person-partition, and direction/scalar as display — record the signature's
active refusal to privilege its own choices rather than a proof that rivals are
impossible.
