  WeldAndArrow.Meta.Glossary
  Canonical glossary data and structural checks
================================================================================

The glossary is the single source for short definitions used by the paper-facing
markdown. Lean checks the office discipline around the prose: term uniqueness,
backward-only `seeAlso` references, and declaration-anchor resolvability. The
accuracy and aptness of the glosses remain prose obligations.
