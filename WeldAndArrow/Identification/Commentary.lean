C.0 Naming and Scope

Names beginning `Waa` mark identifiers that assert a system-POV reading: what
the concept looks like from this grid, not what the concept is in a detached
doctrinal voice. The marker covers ownership, appropriation, whose-ness,
reach-back, sowing-side aiming, four-truths mismatch vocabulary, and sraddha
conditional vocabulary such as `WaaMismatchGrade`, `WaaMismatchLive`,
`WaaAversionContext`, `WaaFullyEnlightened`, and the tariki/jiriki line
readings. Doctrine names are carried by module names and commentary headings;
checked reading identifiers use the single `Waa` marker.

Unprefixed names remain the neutral delivery, order, token-projection, and
tier-placement vocabulary, including `SameAgentDelivery` and
`CrossAgentDelivery`. `Grid.DirectedConvention` marks vocabulary that consumes
the directional reading of `conditions`; the primitive signature itself does
not add asymmetry, irreflexivity, or transitivity premises to `conditions`.

C.1 Signature/Order.lean, Signature/Grid.lean, Signature/BeingConvention.lean,
    Signature/Models.lean, Signature/Claims.lean

`Signature/Assumptions.lean` is the canonical, compile-checked list of the
Signature layer's assumptions; this commentary supplies the paper-facing
motivation around those inputs.

`Config` is the formal place where "nothing self-indexed is stored" is enforced:
it carries only a `Contrib`-valued tendency and no owner, being, or weld field.
This is the type-level version of the paper's internal mis-feed discipline.
`Identification/Registers.lean` records the register table for the same sorting:
field facts are carried, weld facts are spent, and grade statements are stated.

Seeds, potency, and environs talk in the paper are read here as field-side
delivery lines (`conditions`) and candidate receptions, not as capacities stored
in a being. The alaya/bija-as-stored-state reading is deliberately not taken.

The direction-freedom of `conditions` is a modelling decision tied to Theory:
Karma, "The arrow retyped: direction as display". `ConditionsEither` records the
symmetrized field fact, while `Grid.DirectedConvention` names the reading layer
that consumes ordered roles. The thermodynamic/arrow-of-time gloss motivates the
reading but is never a premise of a theorem.

`RawWeld`, `Grid.index`, and `Grid.share` encode the MMK 8 point that there is no
separate prior act or performer inside the formal signature: the index and share
are projections from a completed weld. `no_agent_recovery_of_field_collision`
is the internal recovery obstruction corresponding to that gloss.

`SelfLineWitness` records that self-lines are permitted by the signature and
can satisfy the ownership-face vocabulary when the model supplies reflexive
delivery. The compile-checked pins for the input-side assumptions live in
`Signature/Assumptions.lean`; their canonical prose and downstream anchor
metadata live in `Meta/AssumptionLedger.lean`. The paper's shushō-ittō
discussion is a reading of that permission, not a premise.

The hand-rolled `Preorder` is used for dependency-freedom and to keep the exact
assumptions visible. Mathlib has the counterparts `Preorder`, `OrderBot`, and
`IsBot`; the local `AtBot` is the order-class of the chosen bottom and is
equivalent in role to Mathlib's `IsBot` predicate for that element.

There is no `PreorderTop`: the solipsist/total-share gloss in the paper is an
asymptote, not an attained element. By contrast, `PreorderBot` supplies an
attained bottom so `AtBot` can express the share-zero pole as an order-class.

`Stone`, `Terminus`, `AtPoleClass`, and `stone_is_terminus_vacuously` implement
the function/share split discussed in Theory: Attainment. A stone has no mounted
response; a terminus has mounted responses whose grade lies at the pole-class.

`rePitch` keeps `_before` in the signature because the operation is conceptually
on a prior configuration, even though the current simple implementation depends
only on the received weld. `IsShareDrop` is the strict order comparison
`Strict (G.share received) before.tendency`.

`Signature/BeingConvention.lean` records the reading in which fine tags may be
diagnosed as macro beings. Its examples accommodate the paper's sentient,
hare's-horn, buddha, and generated-boundary cases without adding a privileged
partition to `Grid`. `Signature/Models.lean` holds the concrete clock and
register-clock witnesses consumed by later taxonomy checks.

`Signature/DirectionConvention.lean` records the parallel delivery-axis reading
in which a model may be diagnosed through finite clock resolution. A
`DirectionCoarsening` supplies ticks over welds without adding a field to
`Grid`; `ResolutionBounded` says only that same-tick welds have
order-equivalent shares in the chosen display. The point is deliberately
display-side: sub-tick delivery cannot carry strict `TimeDirection`, but no
stone, terminus, sentience, pole-class, or self-index predicate consumes the
coarsening.

The separate/fuse interface (`ClaimLanguage`, `Distinction`,
`RecordedUtterance`, `Tier`) is the small formal surface needed for the fox,
Baizhang, shō/shu, genjō, and verdict-tier discussions. The formal module keeps
only the abstract interface; this commentary retains the textual motivation.

C.2 Consequences/Basic.lean, Consequences/Taxonomy.lean,
    Consequences/Compounds.lean, Consequences/Ladder.lean, and
    Consequences/ContentRows.lean; Identification/Ownership.lean

The consequence layer proves neutral facts about the definitions: function/share
facts, share-drop obstruction at the pole, delivery and landing projections, and
tier diagnostics. The generated table rows live in `Consequences/Taxonomy.lean`;
the re-emptying machinery lives in `Consequences/Ladder.lean`; and the
content-bearing layer rows live in `Consequences/ContentRows.lean`. The paper's
readings of these facts live here as commentary only; the theorem statements
consume only the neutral definitions.

The strictness facts are now in `Signature/Order.lean` as `Strict`,
`strict_irrefl`, `strict_asymm`, `strict_trans`,
`strict_of_le_of_strict`, `strict_of_strict_of_le`,
`not_strict_of_orderEq`, and `no_strict_of_all_orderEq`. The arrow-of-time gloss
uses `Grid.DirectedConvention.TimeDirection`, an abbreviation of `Strict`.
`strict_shareBot_of_hasSelfPoleIndex` and its re-rooted
`timeDirection_of_hasSelfPoleIndex` reading make a live share itself the
direction witness against bottom. `DirectionVoid` names the absence of any
strict comparison, while `AllStone` names the grid-wide absence of response
function.

`RowTag`, `RowClaim`, `rowLanguage`, and `rowOf` now generate the table's
schema rows with pole-affirming semantics. `beforeAfterRow`, `beingsRow`,
`gridLensRow`, and `weldRow` are compatibility names for `.layer` tags in that
schema. Their collapse and freeze checks remain hypothesis-free; their
obedience theorems carry only the local `AtBot` stability needed for non-live
genjo fusion. The full row list is Lean data as `tableOrder`.

`intraWeldArrow` is a `ConventionLayer`, not a bare row tag, because it names
the convention by which the two faces of a weld are ordered. Its content denial
is response-invariance: if no being's response varies with call, the call-face
does no work, so there is no interior order to read. The conditional obedience
theorem therefore asks for `∃ b, G.ResponseVariesWithCall b`, parallel to the
directed-time row's strictness witness. A single recorded utterance of the
content denial does not by itself extract two different responses from two
calls, so the shipped utterance theorem is the schema-level live-tier misfit
form, routed through `denied_misfits_live_offer`.

`doerDeed` is a schema-only `RowTag`. The tempting content form, "the doer is
prior to the deed", would require adding a priority structure to the opaque
signature, thereby installing exactly the furniture MMK 8 is being used to
deny. The floor-furniture flank is instead carried by
`DoerDeedNegative.no_priority_recovery`, a witness that the same visible grid
data support both a prior-doer reading and a mutual-dependence reading. Fusion
remains ordinary row trivialization: the code nowhere says that doer and deed
merge into one thing.

The generator-discipline check is the same one that motivated `weldRow`: a
generated row should name the convention whose collapse/freeze it diagnoses.
`intraWeldArrow` names the face-order convention; `doerDeed` names the
doer/deed ordering, with the `RawWeld` being component as its concrete anchor
but without promoting priority to a field. The labels "coming-to" and
"going-from" are display names for transposed readings of the two weld faces,
not new tier names.

`ReflexivityWitness.ladderRungGrid` is deliberately only one legal grid: it
instantiates `Being` with `Nat` read as rung labels and then reruns the beings
ladder. This does not define beings as rungs, and it leaves
`BeingNegative.no_partition_recovery` untouched.

`Consequences/Compounds.lean` records the compound-position decompositions as
the same kind of paper-facing data plus `rfl` pins used by placements and the
table order. Its components are classificatory rather than probative: citing a
cell does not prove a row collapses or freezes, because the generated rows
already carry their own refutations. The type-level guard is that components
can cite only `TableRow`s already in the Grade-1 table; facets mark distinct
prose faces of repeated rows, roles separate stacked cells from Grade-1 cells
riding alongside, and legal elements carry no verdict voice.
`CompoundPosition.ledgerPicture` is the fifth entry: possession-freeze and
transposed-as-mechanism are stacked cells, command-style delivery-arrogation is
the conditional `.alongside` cell, and the causal skeleton is carried as a
legal element. The `.command` facet is row-neutral like the others; it only
keeps the command face from collapsing into the exit-premise's plain
delivery-index citation.

The `contentLayerLanguage` keeps the convention-live side as the live-share
condition and gives row-specific content to the denial side. Its obedience
theorems are aptness-conditional by design: where the denial is simply true,
the convention row should not be held. This track deliberately keeps
`LayerClaim`: global denials such as all-stone, direction-void, no-live-tier,
or no-actual-weld cannot be made pole-affirming by truth at a particular genjo
weld. `RecordedUtterance` supplies the actuality needed for the content
utterance checks, while `denied_misfits_live_offer` and
`fox_utterance_misfits_live_offer` perform the same live-tier check for the
schema language.

The `reEmptied` transformer and `ladder` iterate the separate/fuse rule without
adding a claim that quantifies over all levels. `ErrorFree`,
`reEmptied_obeys_of_errorFree`, and `ladder_obeys_of_errorFree` record the
refutation-only route by which the implemented `finalBelow` side lets the
ladder climb without an added stability premise above the seed. The "completed
ladder" remains an instructive absence: level quantification appears only in
meta-theorems such as `ladder_obeys`, `no_level_final_of_obeys`, and the
existential guard `no_final_level_of_errorFree`. Concrete witnesses such as
`shareZero_not_functionZero_witness`, `rung_not_pole_witness`,
`backsliding_witness`, `backsliding_rePitchSequence_witness`,
`standing_does_not_determine_dated`, `subitism_possibility_witness`,
`waaSuddenArrival_witness`, `waaGradualArrival_witness`,
`rate_invisible_to_config`,
`cetana_grading_tracks_weld_not_field_witness`,
`cetana_live_share_without_object_standing_witness`, and the
`registerClock_staticized_*` checks keep the row anchors model-checked.
`standing_does_not_determine_dated` and `subitism_possibility_witness` share
the same clock-grid witness deliberately: the first serves the disposition/act
retype, while the second names the sudden/gradual possibility claim.
`waaSuddenArrival_witness` gives the doctrine-facing one-step form with
actuality, `waaGradualArrival_witness` gives the register-clock staged form,
and `rate_invisible_to_config` deliberately reuses `rePitch_forgets` as the
rate-invariance anchor.
`MemoryWitness.memory_witness` uses the same register-clock shape to display
recall as reception: `recall_waaOwnershipFace` names the delivered trace,
`falseMemory_waaVacuousOwnershipFace` names the unfilled second place, and
`recall_spent` names the `rePitch_forgets` spentness. The memory names stay
separate even where their concrete welds coincide with the prudence witness, so
the two pressure-tests can cite the same registers without depending on each
other.
`withRespondsTo` and `staticized` are the futility operation: delivery-loss is
real (`futility_delivery_loss_real`) while object-axis standing is unchanged
(`Grid.DirectedConvention.staticized_objectAxisStanding_iff`).

C.2a Identification/Absences.lean

`InstructiveAbsence` mirrors the paper's section 3 list as inspectable data.
The enum is not an editorial layer: entries remain members while the paper keeps
them in section 3. `AbsenceStatus` records the mutable world-facing fact, so the
third arrival is `retiredAsCheck` rather than deleted or renumbered. The same
rule applies to future retirements: constructors track the section list, while
`status` carries whether an entry still stands.

The anchors are citations and shape checks, not new doctrine. Empty table cells
are recorded beside `tableOrder` as `hasCollapseOccupant` and
`hasFreezeOccupant`; `emptyCells_anchor` checks that a dash remains metadata
while row refutations remain theorem facts. `foxNeverTestsPole_anchor` cites the
concrete fox model's `fox_never_tests_pole`; the recorded-utterance and
agent-side checks keep the worked case away from both share-zero and the
pole-class. `thirdArrival_not_waaMismatchLive` reuses the terminus-response
four-truth theorem: the retired absence is kept as the dukkha-free check. The
fourth-truth, no-safe-stage, and prudential-privilege anchors cite
`waaPathOught_conditional`, `no_final_level_of_errorFree`, and
`PrudentialPrivilegeNegative.not_prudentialPrivilege`. The declined case,
why-calls-land, and no-measure entries deliberately have only data/status pins:
their missing theorem is the content the paper assigns them.

C.3 Meta/Invariance.lean and Meta/InvarianceNegative.lean

`DisplayReparam` is the admission criterion for predicates that mention the
contribution carrier: they must transport across order-preserving and
pole-preserving changes of display convention. This is the formal counterpart
of treating contribution values as display conventions rather than operational
tokens.

The condition-transpose operation and its being-coarsening companion now live in
the signature layer, beside the `conditions`, `DeliveredTo`, and
`BeingCoarsening` vocabulary they transport. `Meta/Invariance.lean` remains the
central home for `DisplayReparam` and all `map_*` transport lemmas.
`transpose_transpose`, `map_transpose`, `staticized_transpose`, and
`map_staticized` pin the three axis operations as definitionally orthogonal:
reversing delivery, changing display, and removing a response function do not
secretly implement one another.
`DirectionCoarsening.transpose_subTickDelivery` is the delivery-axis companion:
tick equality survives transposition, while the delivery line reverses.
`DirectionCoarsening.displayMapDir`, `mapDir_sameTick_iff`, and
`mapDir_resolutionBounded_iff` centralize its display transport.

`Meta/InvarianceNegative.lean` holds the countermodels. `InvarianceNegative`
explains why equality with the chosen bottom is not the system predicate:
equality-to-bottom fails to transport, while `AtBot` and `Terminus` do.

`DirectionNegative` is the countermodel behind Theory: Karma, "the arrow
retyped": two grids agree on `ConditionsEither` and disagree on `conditions`, so
the symmetric field structure does not recover direction. The physics and
thermodynamics language motivates the reading, but no theorem depends on it.

`InteriorDirectionNegative` is the same demotion one grain down. `RawWeld`
keeps its named `call` and `response` fields because those names are useful
display labels, just as `index` remains a useful projection after the
self-pole demotion. `RawWeld.transposeCR` is only a smuggling detector on
same-carrier call/response examples: unordered pair-content cannot recover
which face is call, so the intra-weld arrow is not before-and-after furniture
inside the weld.

`DirectionCoarseningWitness` adds the finite-resolution check. The raw
register clock cannot be given a universal tick with `ResolutionBounded` over
the injective `Nat` display; a lawful fully coarse display uses the one-point
carrier, whose `DirectionVoid` is obtained through the existing legal
all-equivalent display collapse. The independence witness keeps the register
clock's macro sentience and self-conditioning separate from any direction
coarsening or resolution-bound hypothesis.

`BeingNegative` is the parallel countermodel for designation: one fine grid
allows both merge and split macro readings, so a unique being-boundary is not
recoverable from the grid data alone.

`WeldNegative` lowers the same freedom witness from who-counts-as-one-being to
what-counts-as-one-act. Its `WeldSegmentation` is deliberately local to the
negative witness: segmentation is a diagnosis-time reading over completed
welds, not a new `RawWeld` field and not a new `Grid` parameter. The layer
route for `weldRow` follows from that choice. The weld-grain is a convention
the lens can diagnose exactly like directed time, beings, and the grid-lens;
a bare `RowTag` would have named a row without naming the convention whose
freeze and collapse the row is supposed to catch.

`ContentNegative` supplies the countermodels for the aptness hypotheses on
content rows: an all-stone/no-live grid and the two-bottom direction-void
carrier make the relevant denials true at non-live act-time, so fusion fails
there. The empty-domain witnesses separate two additional vacuities:
`emptyCallGrid_false_stone_and_respondsToEveryCall` shows that no calls make
stone and call-entire response coincide, while `emptyBeingGrid_no_liveTier` and
`contentBeingsRow_obeys_emptyBeing` show that no beings leave no act-time tier
on which the content row can fail to fuse.

`CoverageNegative` certifies the coverage hypotheses on
`directionVoid_of_surjective` and `map_waaFullyEnlightened_of_surjective`:
strictness outside the image of a display reparameterization can make
direction-voidness and faith-closure fail to preserve, parallel in duty to the
aptness countermodels above.

C.4 Doctrines/FourTruths.lean, Doctrines/Sraddha.lean,
    Doctrines/Faith.lean, Doctrines/Ethics.lean, and the sibling negative modules

`WaaMismatchGrade` is definitionally `share`; this is the formal honesty clause
for dukkha-talk as covariation rather than a second measure. `WaaMismatchLive`
adds occurrence actuality to the self-pole-index condition, so stones fall
outside the domain by `not_actual_of_stone`, and terminus responses fall to the
pole-class by the existing terminus theorem.

`WaaAversionContext` treats sraddha reception per call: it packages a live
prior tendency and an actual live-mismatch reception, not a stored faith
possession. `WaaFullyEnlightened` deliberately has two conjuncts: terminus
typing and universal shortfall closure for delivered deeds. The physician
simile belongs exactly there: the grid can prove `waaPathOught_conditional`,
but the antecedents are faith-shaped and are never discharged by field facts.
The faith-object therefore cannot be replaced by anything the fetter lattice
names: the total-rectangle cut lacks function by
`FettersNegative.total_cut_carries_no_function`, and even the live fiber reading
lacks effectiveness by
`FettersNegative.total_cut_with_function_not_waaFullyEnlightened`.

`WaaFaithPrinciple` abstracts the sraddha antecedent to testimony: faith in
enlightenment transmits truth to recorded utterances, with
`waaPathClaimLanguage` instantiating the `ClaimLanguage` interface for the
physician's sentence. `FaithNegative` shows the principle exceeds its own
faith-object, so the "never discharged by field facts" clause survives the
abstraction.

`WaaEthicsStance` bundles the two undischarged antecedents -- principle and
faith -- as the agent's contribution; `WaaEthicalCode` is the fourth-truth
ought generalized over the faith-object's recorded testimony, still an
implication type only. The deontic work is done by the receiver's own
`WaaAversionContext`, not by testimony's truth: the physician's sentence is
practical only where shortfall is live. `EthicsNegative` keeps the code honest
three ways: empty at the pole, unsatisfiable over false testimony, and relative
to the faith-object.

`Doctrines/SraddhaNegative.lean` keeps that conditional honest.
`SraddhaNegative` shows that dropping faith or dropping the live-aversion
antecedent loses the landing, and `OrthogonalityNegative` shows that a
responsive terminus need not be `WaaFullyEnlightened`.
The opposite regime face is checked by
`waaFullyEnlightened_of_responsiveTerminus_of_undelivered`: with no delivered
own deeds, the closure conjunct holds vacuously. Teaching and non-teaching are
delivery facts around a terminus, not two being-natures stored in it.
`Doctrines/Shusho.lean` retypes the operational content as
`WaaEnlightenedOccurrence`: an actual pole-deed landing as a share-drop against
a live prior tendency. The standing universal survives only as display and
faith-object; `WaaEnlightenmentEnacted` and `not_enacted_of_undelivered` fence
the sealed-regime vacuity from an enacted occurrence. `FullEnlightenmentNegative`
turns the old prose warning into a collision: changing only `conditions` leaves
actual response/share data fixed while flipping `WaaFullyEnlightened`.

C.5 Doctrines/Deliberation.lean

`ConsequentialistConvention` is a descriptive reading layer. `DropCount` and
`DropCountInFiber` count share-drop receptions across finite actual runs without
adding probability, utility, or a command register. Their transport lemmas in
`Meta/Invariance.lean` discharge the C.3 admission criterion for using them as
display readings. `dropCountInFiber_le_dropCount` gives the per-fiber bound,
and `dropCount_eq_sum_dropCountInFiber` says a complete noduplicate tag list
adds the fibers back to the total; `map_dropCountInFiberSum` transports the
sum. `ObjectiveNegative` reuses the merge/split being-convention pattern to
show that "my drops" is not a function of grid data alone, with
`split_dropCount_sum_eq_mergedDropCount` as the concrete census check.

`backsliding_witness` gives the direct same-grid shape: a share-drop reception
to the pole-class followed by a later actual live-share weld by the same
being. `backsliding_rePitchSequence_witness` routes the same shape through
`ReceptionPair.rePitchSequence`. `rePitch_forgets` and
`accumulated_attainment_constant_of_same_final` restate backsliding in the form
a maximizer needs: no accumulated attainment variable is stored in `Config`.
`TransferNegative` records the adaptive track-record obstruction and the
`ResponseInvariant` contrast case. `grade_independent_of_conditions` and
`share_independent_of_conditions` keep the cetana claim at signature level:
grade and share do not consume downstream delivery conditions. The concrete
cetana witnesses are `cetana_grading_tracks_weld_not_field_witness` (same
field residue, different share) and
`cetana_live_share_without_object_standing_witness` (live share where standing
fails). The AN 6.63 correlation itself and the comparative no-common-event
reading remain prose-bound. `DeliveryArrogationNegative` instantiates the
`ClaimLanguage` machinery for a command-shaped delivery claim and checks that a
recorded plan fails `FitsOfferedTier` where delivery is absent.

C.6 Identification/Placements.lean, Identification/Registers.lean, and
    Identification/Disclaimers.lean

The contemporary placements and disclaimer-5 register sorting are paper-facing
taxonomies kept in the office/placement pattern: data plus `rfl` pins, not a
semantic interpretation of grid vocabulary. `SortedFact.register` is total over
the table instances, so exhaustiveness of the three registers is carried by the
definition rather than asserted as a separate theorem. The
`nothing_selfIndexed_carried` check is the enumerated face of the same
discipline enforced architecturally by `Config`: no owner or self-index field is
stored between deeds.

C.7 Doctrines/Ledger.lean

The ledger case is run in code rather than read into it; this section is the
reading, and the module's own header is the map. `MountsOnlyIn` is the
function-side register/modality predicate - deliberately neutral vocabulary,
like `MountsAt` and `ResponseInvariant`, because a receiver's open register is
a fact about `respondsTo`, not a Waa reading. `landing_call_in_modality` is
the response-shape fact the paper calls a theorem: any landing at a
modality-restricted receiver carries a call in the modality, so the form of
the answer that reaches the ledger is fixed by the ledger. The proof is
near-definitional by design; `LedgerCase` discharges the non-vacuity duty the
way `clockGrid` does for the function/share split. Hakuin's corrective, upaya,
and the wisdom of the code remain display.

`fiber_landing_call_in_modality` is the compression clause: where every fine
tag under a macro tag shares the register, one answer reaches the fiber. The
hypothesis is stated on `κ.proj` directly; `InFiber` unfolds to the same
equation. Together with `sectorCoarsening` and `BeingNegative`, this is "the
state's Row 2 is a display convention over the officials' welds" with its
legality and its illegality both on record: legal as diagnosis-time coarsening,
unrecoverable as grid-carried partition.

`receptionCommandLanguage` is the deliberate sibling of
`deliveryCommandLanguage` (C.5). The Deliberation negative shows a command over
delivery failing where delivery is absent; the ledger's decree is the scale
case with the opposite delivery polarity - delivered everywhere, landing
nowhere it purports to command. `decree_engineers_calls_not_receptions` keeps
both halves in one statement: suppression is grid-legal call-engineering, and
the reception register stays uncommanded.

The census's two named faces (`ledger_census_misfits_live_offer`,
`ledger_prognosis_misfits_live_offer`) delegate to `denied_misfits_live_offer`
at `.perCallGlobal` and `.standingDated`, exactly as the fox's marquee theorem
does at `.foxWeld`. No `RowTag` is added: the module's checked form of "three
errors, zero new cells" is that its taxonomy content is entirely delegation.
The third error's anchors are section 2 of the module plus the Deliberation
negative; the exit-collapse's corrective is model-checked as
`purge_object_axis_subtraction_nil` with `corpus_still_delivered`.

The Huichang face reuses the futility operation unchanged: `staticized`,
`futility_delivery_loss_real`, `staticized_responseInvariant`, and
`staticized_objectAxisStanding_iff` are consumed, not reproved.
`purge_loop_runs_on` is the one genuinely new futility-face check: the
non-staticized reception is still actual, which is the "loop ran on" clause
stated as a model fact.

Grades in `LedgerCase` are uniformly live and no being is pole-typed: the case
asserts nothing about Baizhang's attainment, and the model is built so it
cannot accidentally do so. The pedigree flag on the Pure Rules attribution is
carried in the module header; the theorems consume the shape only. What the
module declines is what the paper declines: no theorem asserts that the code
saved Chan, that the state was wrong, or that the survival was worth having -
the first is the historians', the second is ungradeable by the no-value clause,
the third is valence borrowed from the object.

C.7a Consequences/FoxCase.lean and Doctrines/FoxCase.lean

`FoxCase.foxGrid` runs the paper's paradigm case as a concrete `Grid Nat`.
Life 0 is the old man's answering life, later naturals are fox-life tags, and
the display convention "the fox" is `foxSeriesCoarsening`, a diagnosis-time
merge rather than a stored being. `foxSeries_macro_sentient`,
`foxSeries_macro_selfConditioning`, and `fox_consecutive_lives_distinct` are
the coarsening checks: the macro tag is legal and live, while the fine lives
remain distinct.

The per-beat checks are deliberately small. `fox_sentence_live_selfPole`
records the old answer as actual and live; `fox_arrow_index_free` instantiates
the grade/share independence of delivery; `fox_returns_delivered` gives the
return line from the sentence into later lives; `fox_reception_clenched`,
`fox_config_carries_only_tendency`, and `fox_rePitch_forgets` keep the
receptions actual, live, and non-storing; `fox_release_rung_not_pole`,
`fox_reachBack_full_at_release`, and `fox_nothing_kept` record the turning-word
release as a share-drop, not a pole-arrival or possession. `fox_never_tests_pole`
is intentionally true by construction: no grade in the model is zero, so the
absence of pole-arrival is a displayed boundary of the koan, not a hidden
answer to the terminus question.

The Dogen doubling checks are grid-internal only. `oldMan_utterance_misfits`
delegates the old answer to the fox row's live-tier misfit;
`daishugyo_diagnosis_fits`, `jinshinInga_instruction_fits`,
`jinshinInga_floor_voicing_would_misfit`, and `dogen_doubling_both_fit` type
the two speech-act faces and the counterfactual floor-voicing. They do not
prove the historical claim that this paper follows Daishugyo against the late
Dogen; that disagreement stays prose. The dukkha-facing name
`fox_dukkha_per_life` lives one layer down in `Doctrines/FoxCase.lean` because
it consumes `WaaMismatchGrade` from `FourTruths`.

C.8 Doctrines/Correlations.lean, Doctrines/CorrelationsNegative.lean,
    Doctrines/SuddenGradual*.lean, Doctrines/Fetters.lean, and
    Doctrines/FettersNegative.lean

`Doctrines/Correlations.lean` treats the Ten Bulls, Five Ranks, and stage
schemes as checked correlations over existing machinery. `StageScheme` is just
`BeingCoarsening`; the warning belongs to holding a coarsening as grid-carried
structure, not to any one ladder. `CorrelationsNegative.no_stage_boundary_recovery`
duplicates the being-boundary no-recovery pattern for stage schemes so the
uniform freeze clause is witnessed without importing `Meta` upward into
`Doctrines`.

`Doctrines/SuddenGradual.lean` names the §2 sudden/gradual split without new
cells. `WaaSuddenArrival` is the actual one-step share-drop to the pole-class,
and `waaSuddenArrival_witness` reuses the clock-grid possibility shape.
`WaaGradualArrival` folds a `ShareDropRun` through `rePitchRun`, with
`waaGradualArrival_witness` on `registerClockGrid`. `rate_invisible_to_config`
is exactly `rePitch_forgets`; the run corollaries say config-factoring scores
cannot read the earlier rate once the final reception is fixed.
`SuddenGradualNegative.subitism_frequency_underdetermined` supplies the
honesty clause: response/grade/share data agree while delivery of the
pole-reaching weld differs.

For the Ten Bulls, Bulls 1-6 are a `ShareDropRun`; Bull 7 is
`WaaBullSeven`, probe-constancy plus a live self-pole index. The theorem
`bullSeven_not_bullEight` checks that this half-weld is not the empty-circle
pole-class. Bull 8 is `AtPoleClass`, Bull 9 is `ResponsiveTerminus`, and Bull 10
is the existential cross-fiber delivery predicate `WaaBullTen`. The stronger
`StrongWaaBullTen` is named and shelved: delivery into every sentient fiber is a
stronger bodhisattva reading than the picture asserts. The pratyekabuddha
countermodel shows Bull 9 without Bull 10.

The Five Ranks are data plus reading pins; `kenChuTo_implies_waaBullTen` names
the 到/Bull 10 shape under the same coarsening. This is a retype of ranks as
utterance-diagnosis and index-placement, not a second stage ladder.

`FiberAtPoleOn`, `LiveFiberAtPoleOn`, `FiberAtPoleOnWithin`, and the tag-axis
within vocabulary sit in `Signature/BeingConvention.lean` because they are
neutral fiber restrictions. The restriction now has two axes: call-class and
fine tag-class. `FiberAtPoleOnWithin` is the product, monotone in both
coordinates; the old call-axis and the new tag-axis are its total-class
specializations. Fetters merely consume them: `FetterReading` supplies the
provocation classes as model-side data, `SomaReading` supplies the tag-region
with the same diagnosis-time status, and `FetterCutWithin` means the fiber is
at pole on that fetter's call-class inside that tag-region. Thus a cut is
cessation of enactment in a region, not possession of an anti-fetter.
`classQuiet_no_clench_in_class` and `conceit_excluded_within` are the checked
soul-guards: where the relevant cut holds, no actual weld in that region
carries a live self-pole index. `FettersNegative.no_region_boundary_recovery`
is the freedom witness on the tag axis.

The path scheme is nested class quietness. `Path.cutClasses` gives the stream,
once-return, non-return, and arhat call-classes; once-return adds no new cut
class, matching the prose weakening clause. `Fetter.kind_lower_iff_cut_by_nonReturn`
pins the table coherence: exactly the lower fetters are cut by non-return.
`all_fetters_cut_at_arhatFiber` upgrades the arhat case from samples to
`∀ f : Fetter`. `arhatPathQuiet_iff_fiberAtPole` says the arhat class is total,
so arhat path-quietness is ordinary
`FiberAtPole`. The within-family adds the tag cut. Sravaka-arhat is
`PathQuietWithin` at `SomaReading.speechThoughtTag`; the total calls/total tags
point is neutral, theorem-identical to ordinary `FiberAtPole` by
`arhatWithin_univTags_iff_fiberAtPole`. Vasana remains residual clench enacted
in the complement region after the call-axis closes, an existing-cell reading.

The buddha reading enters only as a three-rung ladder above that neutral point.
Rung 1 is the total-rectangle cut, the share axis alone; the all-stone witness
`FettersNegative.total_cut_carries_no_function` shows that it has no function
conjunct. Rung 2 is the live terminus reading, `LiveFiberAtPole`, with
`sentientTag_iff_actualFiberInhabited` as the bridge from response-function to
actual fiber inhabitation. `FettersNegative.total_cut_with_function_not_waaFullyEnlightened`
checks that rung 2 still lacks effectiveness. Rung 3 is
`WaaFullyEnlightened`, rung 2's quietness plus universal shortfall closure, and
it enters the faith and ethics files only as hypothesis. The shusho-itto face
is now explicit as `WaaEnlightenedOccurrence`; the standing rung is the display
and faith-object, never the act-time verdict. This is the same fox-guard for
sentient and insentient adaptive cases: a standing rank on a responder is the
freeze, while a pole-typed landing is spent per occurrence.

Pratyekabuddha is typed at rung 2 as a regime fact with two faces, not as a
second attainment. Face A is uncooperative delivery: a deed is delivered but no
share drop lands, so `OrthogonalityNegative.waaFullyEnlightened_stronger_than_terminus`
shows failure of `WaaFullyEnlightened`. Face B is sealed delivery:
`waaFullyEnlightened_of_responsiveTerminus_of_undelivered` makes full
enlightenment hold vacuously when no own deed is delivered at all; the enacted
form fails by `not_enacted_of_undelivered`, paralleling the empty-domain
separations in `ContentNegative`. The samyaksambuddha reading is rung 3, the
faith-object. The guard clause is
therefore strict: the model hosts a non-teaching terminus as a regime fact,
never as a being who opts out of being read. This is the taxonomy-freeze cell
for "the private buddha declining his own occurrence at others' Row 2" read
without the freeze: non-teaching is the field declining to deliver, never the
being withdrawing object-axis standing.

The older arhat anchors remain and have region duals:
`identityView_excluded_at_arhatFiber`, `conceit_excluded_at_arhatFiber`,
`arhatFiber_of_termini`, `identityView_excluded_at_speechThoughtRegion`,
`conceit_excluded_within`, and `regionFiber_of_termini`.

Identity-view is the coarsening-freeze enacted: the macro tag held as stored
owner. Its cut is quietness on the identity-view provocation class, so
stream-entry is typed as the cessation of the same attachment the uniform
coarsening clause warns against.

`Doctrines/Factors.lean` adds the path-factor reading over that same fetter
table. `PathFactor.blockerClass` is derived from `FetterReading`, so the factor
scheme is a regrouping of the canonical classes rather than a second taxonomy:
rites is the floor component, view covers identity-view and doubt, and resolve
covers sensual desire and ill will. `FactorHeld` and `FactorReleased` are a
new factor-relation frame. Hold is a witnessed live in-fiber weld in the
factor's blocker class; release is the whole-class `FiberAtPoleOn` cut. Hold is
not an error by itself, since a stage-appropriate hold is correct. The error
taxonomy remains freeze/collapse on utterance distinctions, and clench remains
the share-frame live-index vocabulary. The raft simile lands exactly at
`factorReleased_rites_iff_ritesGrasp_cut`: rites-grasp is the grasping mode of
the first hold, and cutting it is the first release.

The bridge reading over the existing cells is deliberately prose-only: freeze
is a hold maintained past its use, while collapse is a release enacted before
its use. Each stage's characteristic mistakes can therefore be diagnosed as
overstayed hold and premature release on that stage's factor. The four
hold/release combinations, and the eight once-return-to-non-return gradations
they generate when applied across the view and resolve pairs, are
diagnosis-time readings over welds and classes, never stored ranks.
`WaaResolveAttenuation` gives once-return positive content without adding a cut
class: a resolve-class share-drop run can be strict while still stopping short
of the pole. `WaaSerialFactorRegime` is the matching "usually in order"
conditional; `FactorsNegative.seen_run_underdetermines_factorOrder` blocks
deriving that order from the grid alone.

One level up, the Theravada-side risk is overstaying the hold on the scheme
itself: rank, the shit-stick, the coarsening read as carried structure. The
Mahayana-side risk is premature release of diagnosis: the lens-dismissal cell,
checked elsewhere as `lens_denial_collapse_self_refuting`. Emptiness is not
the absence of the coarsening, but the refusal to hold it as grid-carried.
Lineages differ in where the supplied reading puts its weight, not in type
signature; `FactorsNegative.lineage_underdetermined_by_seen_run` specializes
`CorrelationsNegative.no_stage_boundary_recovery` to that switch.

Speech and conduct are named as `PathFactor.speech` and `PathFactor.conduct`,
but their blocker classes are `False` in this phase. The open question is what
"holding a factor" should mean for the upper pair if an arhat is already at
`FiberAtPole`: current `FactorHeld` requires `HasSelfPoleIndex`, and the arhat
anchors refute that fiber-wide. This commit therefore leaves
`arhatPathQuiet_iff_fiberAtPole`, `all_fetters_cut_at_arhatFiber`, the total
arhat class, and `SomaReading.speechThoughtTag` untouched.

Irreversibility is three-layered on both axes. Whole-region `FetterCut` and
`FetterCutWithin` are internally irreversible by quantifier logic: if a later
clenched weld in the relevant rectangle exists, the cut never held. Run-assigned
path tags are only display over seen data, and
`FettersNegative.seen_run_underdetermines_fetterCut` with
`FettersNegative.seen_run_underdetermines_fetterCutWithin` gives the fresh-call
transfer countermodel. A forward guarantee is hostable only as the conditionals
`waaIrreversibleRegime_conditional` and
`waaIrreversibleRegimeWithin_conditional`, parallel in voice to the sraddha
conditional. The orthogonality note is checked by
`unquiet_region_still_functions_witness`: region cuts speak to share; the uncut
region's tags act as fully as the cut region's tags.

C.9 Doctrines/OtherPower.lean and Doctrines/OtherPowerNegative.lean

Other-power is now a checked delivery-regime correlation rather than a prose
appendix to §2. `SameAgentDelivery` and `CrossAgentDelivery` are unprefixed
because they are grid-recoverable facts about a delivery line: the line is
delivered, and the two agent tags are equal or unequal. `WaaJirikiLine` and
`WaaTarikiLine` carry the system-POV reading of those neutral facts.

`reception_typing_ignores_sower` is near-definitional: swapping only
`conditions` leaves a reception's grade, share, and actuality untouched.
`waaReachBack_filled_either_regime` records the one-act-grammar point: once an
actual reception is present, either regime supplies the same ordinary
reach-back relation by projection from delivery.

`TarikiCase` supplies the non-vacuity witness. The name is response-invariant
(`name_responseInvariant`), function-mounted rather than stone
(`name_not_stone`), and share-zero at its welds (`name_share_bot`).
`name_object_axis_entire` delivers the name's weld to every invoker reception,
while `universal_fixed_call_lands_without_reading` assembles the corresponding
`HasShareDropLanding`. This is the effective corner opposite the zero-effect
orthogonality witness: adaptivity and effectiveness are independent. The
invoker's side remains an ordinary deed, checked by
`invoker_reception_is_deed`.

The module deliberately declines polemic. `OtherPowerNegative` gives the two
freedom witnesses: `regime_does_not_determine_share` shows that same-agent and
cross-agent lines each allow live and pole-class receptions, while
`share_does_not_determine_regime` shows that equal reception share does not
recover the regime. That is enough for the svakarma demotion: restricting
delivery to same-agent lines is a regime wall, not a change in reception
typing.

C.10 Doctrines/Gradeability.lean

`SeveredTranscript` is agent plus response rather than response alone because
the strongest natural form of a quotation is still attributed. If even that
stronger record cannot recover grade, then the bare response-only case is
covered a fortiori. The type deliberately carries no `call`, no `offeredAt`,
and no `actual`, so it cannot be fed to `RecordedUtterance.FitsOfferedTier`;
there is no positioned utterance for the taxonomy to classify.

`Grid.Weld.sever` and `Grid.RecordedUtterance.sever` are forgetting maps. The
negative theorem `GradeabilityNegative.no_grade_recovery_from_severed` uses the
standard collision pattern: two actual welds with the same severed transcript
and different shares force any correct estimator to assign one value two ways.
`backslideGrid` supplies the concrete carrier in the missing-call direction:
one agent gives the same response to gentle and harsh calls, with different
shares. This is named by
`GradeabilityNegative.gradeability_severed_underdetermination_witness` and
instantiated as `GradeabilityNegative.severed_transcript_ungradeable`.

`recordedUtterance_grade_determined` is the positive half as an `rfl` pin: a
recorded utterance carries the whole weld, so its grade factors through the
record by definition. The koan-form identification, the normative rule "may
grade only where the call is carried", the quotable/gradeable genre contrast,
and the Hakuin-epigram pedigree flag remain prose. The code checks the
underdetermination fact and the carried-call architecture only.

C.11 Meta/VerdictLedger.lean

`generatorRecord` is the theorem-file verdict history rendered as data, not as
a semantic interpretation of the generator. Its entries are episode-grained:
Zahavi, the disposition/act cell, the arrow, and the intra-weld arrow are four
retypes, so `generatorRecord_retype_count` is a check over the list rather
than a stored multiplicity. The `anchors` field records the heterogeneity the
paragraph needs: Zahavi and the disposition/act retype are prose-anchored, the
arrow pins `DirectionNegative`, the intra-weld arrow pins
`InteriorDirectionNegative`, and the answered cases name their theorem
anchors.

`restraintKind` is the legal coarsening. It projects the nine entries to the
six display kinds, while `generatorRecord_restraintKind_seen_count` and
`restraintKind_exhaustive_on_record` check the image. The ledger still adds no
new-cell entry: `generatorRecord_newCell_count` is zero, so it records the
generator's self-restraint independently of the weld-grain row added by the
convention-layer schema.

`misFeed_entries_carry_decomposition` checks only the structural half of the
falsifier: entries tagged as requiring a mis-feed decomposition carry one. The
rate-trend clause and the claims that the retypes were forced, timely, and
historically prior remain prose, because they quantify over the history rather
than over the current record.

C.12 Meta/Glossary.lean

`Meta/Glossary.lean` is the canonical glossary source. The three markdown
glossaries are retired in favor of generated output from
`WeldAndArrow/Gen/Glossary.lean`; the paper-facing table lives at
`Exposition/Glossary.md`.

The module checks office discipline, not exposition itself. `glossary.length`
pins the curated table size, the term strings are `Nodup`, every `seeAlso`
target resolves to an earlier row, and `#verify_glossary_anchors` checks that
all named Lean anchors exist in the environment. Empty anchors are allowed for
terms whose public gloss is prose-only. Gloss accuracy, canonical nuance, and
the adequacy of each gloss for newcomers remain prose obligations; expert
caveats live in the Disclaimers.

C.13 Doctrines/Icchantika.lean

`Icchantika` is entered as a declined foreclosure case rather than as a stored
negative kind. The formal reading is deliberately literal and run-shaped:
function is mounted somewhere, and every mounted response is live at the
self-pole index. That makes the being non-stone and anti-terminus on its run,
so `not_waaFullyEnlightened_of_icchantika` gives the honest agent-role bar:
this run cannot seat the icchantika as the enlightened agent, because
`WaaFullyEnlightened` includes terminus typing.

The receiver-side result points the other way.
`aversionContext_of_icchantika_reception` says an actual icchantika reception
with live prior tendency supplies the `WaaAversionContext` antecedent, and
`icchantika_reachable` routes that antecedent through the existing sraddha
conditional. Thus the icchantika is maximally available as receiver exactly
where it is unseatable as terminus-agent on the same run.

`icchantika_release_not_foreclosed` is the anti-rank check. A concrete
icchantika-typed receiver can itself be part of a share-drop landing from a
higher prior tendency, so the run's clenched profile does not recover a
permanent no-landing verdict. This is the same discipline as backsliding in
reverse: attainment is not stored, and neither is non-attainment. The fighting
stance is a seed, not a rank.
