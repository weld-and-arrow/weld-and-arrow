   Section 3 instructive absences
============================================================================== -/

/-- Whether a section 3 absence is still open or has been delivered and retained
    as a regression check.

    Membership and status are deliberately separate: `InstructiveAbsence`
    constructors track the paper's section 3 list, while `status` tracks the
    world-facing fact of whether an entry is still standing. Retiring another
    absence should change its status, not delete its constructor or renumber the
    list. -/
inductive AbsenceStatus where
  | standing
  | retiredAsCheck

/-- The section 3 instructive absences: gaps the system generates deliberately,
    each doing diagnostic work rather than marking a lacuna. -/
inductive InstructiveAbsence where
  /-- Empty cells in the Grade-1 table: not every distinction is symmetric.
      The diagnostic work is the table asymmetry itself; errors do not lie on a
      single line. -/
  | emptyCells
  /-- The declined case: the deaf-blind being receives no error verdict. The
      diagnostic work is the refusal to over-generate; the errors nearby belong
      to the diagnostician. -/
  | declinedCase
  /-- What the fox never tests: neither worked utterance occurs at the pole.
      The diagnostic work is to force the terminus question to be answered
      outside the paradigm case. -/
  | foxNeverTestsPole
  /-- The third arrival: the never-clenched candidate is delivered from the
      stone side. The diagnostic work now lives as a check: function mounted,
      no share ever claimed, dukkha-free by construction. -/
  | thirdArrival
  /-- Why calls land at all: receptive moments exist on the adaptive side and
      any landing occurs on the fixed-call side. The diagnostic work is to leave
      delivery ceded as a world-fact rather than a theorem manufactured by the
      grid. -/
  | whyCallsLand
  /-- The fourth truth withheld from the theory's voice: the grid displays the
      fourth-truth shape but does not utter the detached command. The diagnostic
      work is the no-value clause itself: room and shape, no pull. -/
  | fourthTruthWithheld
  /-- No stage immune to error: a terminal safe cell would be a rank. The
      diagnostic work is to keep even buddha-immunity per-call rather than
      possessed. -/
  | noSafeStage
  /-- Prudential privilege underivable: special first-personal authority over
      future concern is absent as a theorem. The diagnostic work is the
      forward-facing twin of the cross-gap whose being refused. -/
  | prudentialPrivilege
  /-- No measure over the grade: the order is partial and display-facing. The
      diagnostic work is to make the missing scalar deliberate; no probability
      or metric apparatus is owed over grade or delivery. -/
  | noMeasure
  /-- The icchantika declined: a non-stone being live at every mounted call
      (the terminus's inverse) is reachable as a receiver and un-seatable as an
      enlightened agent on its run, yet receives no permanent "cannot become
      buddha" verdict. The diagnostic work is the refusal to type foreclosure as
      a stored kind; defiance is a seed, not a rank. -/
  | icchantikaDeclined
  /-- The cosmology of rebirth — persistence across biological death, the
      realms, and the mechanism — is ceded as a world-fact. The grammar of
      ownerless continuation (continuity without a carried bearer; the flame
      passed without a self) remains in scope, derived from
      `nothing_selfIndexed_carried` and the field/re-pitch machinery. What is
      ceded lies downstream of where the Row-2 domain of mounted responses ends:
      the consciousness question the grid brackets as domain, not phenomenality.
      The diagnostic work is to mark this boundary rather than manufacture a
      theorem across it. -/
  | rebirthCosmology
  /-- No positive Truth or Thus predicate is defined at the floor. The floor is
      present only through silence, indiscernibility, and the negative
      pole/floor family. The diagnostic work is the registered refusal to turn
      degeneracy into a truth-maker. -/
