  WeldAndArrow.Doctrines.Gradeability
  Gradeability for call-carrying records
================================================================================

The theorem-file gradeability rule says that the taxonomy may grade a recorded
utterance only where the record carries its call. This module checks the
formal part of that rule: severing a response from its call underdetermines the
grade, while a `RecordedUtterance` carries the call through its `weld`. The
normative discipline, the koan-form genre claim, and the Hakuin-epigram
pedigree note remain prose.

Reading and motivation: Identification/Commentary.lean, C.10.

/-- A quotation in its strongest severed form: the response is attributed to
    an agent, but the call that made it an occurrence has been forgotten. There
    is deliberately no `call`, no `offeredAt`, and no `actual` field here. With
    no `offeredAt`, this record cannot even be supplied to `FitsOfferedTier`:
    nothing is positioned for the taxonomy to classify. The generator-side
    standing verdict is therefore `severedVerdict`, a decline rather than a
    grade. -/
