  WeldAndArrow.Doctrines.OtherPowerNegative
  Negative witnesses for regime/share polemics
================================================================================

The positive module types same-agent and cross-agent delivery as regimes over
the same act grammar. This sibling keeps the no-polemic clause honest: neither
regime determines reception share, and reception share does not recover the
regime.
