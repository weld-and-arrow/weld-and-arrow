  WeldAndArrow.Doctrines.Deliberation
  Consequentialist display and deliberator-side underdetermination
================================================================================

This module records the checked face of the deliberator block: drop-counting as
a reading, the non-accumulation consequence of `rePitch`, the being-boundary and
transfer countermodels, invariance of grade under delivery conditions, and a
claim-language witness for delivery-arrogation.

Reading and motivation: Identification/Commentary.lean, C.5.
