   Outside note this responds to: "Non-typeability is demonstrated by failed
   elaboration, not proved. The internal alternative is to model a universe of
   designations and prove ¬∃ f : FieldFact → Index ... under your axioms."

   The internal route is used here, with the modest scope made explicit.

/-- The field-side residue of a weld: everything left once the agent is not
    part of the data. The honest field-fact for recovering an index is
    `Call × Response`, never `Being`. -/
def Grid.fieldOf (w : G.Weld) : G.Call × G.Response := (w.call, w.response)

/-- Naively, "no function `Call × Response → Being` exists" is false whenever
    `Being` is nonempty: a constant function typechecks. What matters is the
    correctness-carrying version, a function claimed to recover, for every
    actual weld, the agent that in fact produced its field residue.

    The theorem below therefore has the honest scope of the claim: no such
    recovery can be correct when two different beings can actually produce the
    same response to the same call. It is not a blanket claim about every
    `Grid`; it is the internal witness that field residues under-determine who
    acted. -/

   Second concrete display — integer registers with diagnosis-time κ

   The adaptive register clock builds its fine tags as integer-like registers.
   The macro designation is still supplied outside the signature, by a
   `BeingCoarsening`: the model may implement stable internal registers, but
   the standing partition is not stored as "the" being-boundary.

/- `clockGrid` is a genuine, finite, computable term of type `Grid Nat` —
    direct evidence that "a model of the theory" is a buildable Lean
    object, and that facts about a concrete instance are provable at
    `rfl`-level once the instance is fixed. That is the tool a later
    independence result needs: fix a small `Grid`, choose an actual
    `ReceptionPair`, run the relevant `Config`/`rePitch` steps, phrase
    whatever "privilege" would have to assert as a further `Prop` over that
    data, and show it fails in the instance. That construction is not
    carried out here — deciding how to phrase "privilege" formally is itself
    a nontrivial choice belonging to whoever proves the theorem, not to the
    scaffolding. What this section checks is only that the scaffolding does
    not get in the way. -/
