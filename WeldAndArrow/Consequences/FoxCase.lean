  WeldAndArrow.Consequences.FoxCase
  The fox koan as a concrete grid run-through
================================================================================

This module gives the fox sentence a checked model: call, act, weld, arrow,
returns, clenched receptions, release-as-rung, nothing-kept, and the deliberately
built-in absence of any pole-class act in the case.

Reading and motivation: Identification/Commentary.lean, C.7a.
